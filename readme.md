# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Contained within this directory you will find infrastructure as code for the MLOps V2. The code comes in three different formats:
- ARM Templates
- Bicep Templates
- Terraform Templates

Within each format you can also find a public IP version of the code and a private IP version of the code.
